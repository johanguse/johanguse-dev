Upon know about Hanko's Hackathon, I was quick to conceptualize and implement a project using NextJS.
As it happens, Vercel recently released NextJS 14, and I saw it fitting to base this guide on a new installation of this version. For those interested in viewing the project I submitted for the Hackathon, you can access it [here](https://hanko-hackathon.vercel.app/) and the [final code is here](https://github.com/johanguse/hanko_hackathon).

To proceed with this tutorial, it's essential to have NextJS 14 installed. If you haven't done so, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). It's worth noting that I utilized the APP Directory structure coupled with TypeScript.

Once you have NextJS ready, the next step is to integrate Hanko. This integration with Next is achieved using "elements". Following the [official Hanko documentation](https://docs.hanko.io/quickstarts/fullstack/next), I employed `pnpm` for the installation. However, depending on your preference, `npm` or `yarn` are also viable options:

```
pnpm add @teamhanko/hanko-elements
```

For Hanko to function, you must have an account and obtain the API URL:

1. Sign up or log in to your Hanko account.
2. Navigate to your project, or create one if you haven’t already.
3. Retrieve the API URL from the main dashboard.

After obtaining the API URL, make sure to add it to your `.env` file. If you're deploying your site on Vercel, remember to include this in the Vercel dashboard as well.

With the setup complete, you're all set to implement the authentication process. This includes constructing the login/register page, a private dashboard, and a user profile page. To assist you further, I've prepared a boilerplate project with NextJS 14, incorporating App Router, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. You can explore and utilize this repository [here](https://github.com/johanguse/nextjs14-hanko-auth).
