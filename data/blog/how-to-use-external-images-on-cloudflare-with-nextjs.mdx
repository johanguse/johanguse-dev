Today, I decided to deploy one of my testing applications in Next.js to Cloudflare Workers & Pages. The deployment process is similar to Vercel, where I used the dashboard with the option `Next.js (Static HTML Export)` and setup `output: 'export'` enabled in my `next.config`. Everything worked smoothly during deployment until I opened the final version. To my surprise, the external images, in this case, images from the https://pravatar.cc/, were not working as expected.

After some research on the web, I couldn't find a quick answer as I expected. So, I decided to write this short tip to help other developers who might be struggling with the same problem.

This project also serves as a small experiment, involving the recreation of a testimonial using the [new carousel component](https://x.com/shadcn/status/1738283281424982488?s=20). You can find the code for this experiment [here](https://github.com/johanguse/shadcn-carousel-testimonials). I'll delve into how to make external images work seamlessly on Cloudflare Pages. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johanguse).

To fix this issue, we will follow these three steps:

1. Change `next.config`
2. Create a custom image loader to integrate with Cloudflare
3. Redeploy the project.

### 1. `next.config.js`

In the `next.config.js`, make sure that `output: 'export'` is set correctly. This is related to Cloudflare deployment. In my case, I used static deployment (`Next.js (Static HTML Export)`). In the images part, ensure that `remotePatterns` are correctly set according to your external images domain property setup. You can read more about Next.js `remotePatterns` [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns).

### 2. Custom Image Loader

In my case, I created a custom image loader in the `next.config.js` file to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API.

`next.config.js`:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    loader: 'custom',
    loaderFile: './imageLoader.js',
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'i.pravatar.cc',
      },
    ],
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

`imageLoader.js`

```js
interface ImageLoaderParams {
  src: string;
  width: number;
  quality?: number;
}

export const imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality = 75 }: ImageLoaderParams): string =>
  `${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality}`
```

#### Using the Custom Image Loader

Import **imageLoader** from your file and set the Image/next component on your page.

```js
'use client'

import Image from 'next/image'
import { imageLoader } from '@/lib/imageLoader'

<Image loader={imageLoader} height={40} width={40} src={imgSrc} />
```

By following these steps, you can commit the modifications to your repository to trigger a new deployment on the Cloudflare dashboard.
