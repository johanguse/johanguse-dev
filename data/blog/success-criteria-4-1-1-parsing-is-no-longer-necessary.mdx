# WCAG 2.2 Release Date

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is set to release the latest version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.2, in <strong>April 2023</strong>. The publication of WCAG 2.2 will mark an important milestone in the ongoing effort to improve web accessibility and ensure that digital technology is inclusive and accessible to everyone. This new version of the guidelines will bring a number of changes and improvements to the standards for web accessibility, including the removal of Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing.

# What is 4.1.1 Parsing?

WCAG Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing is a guideline that requires web content to be written in a way that web browsers and other user agents can understand. This means the code must be written in a way easily parsed and understood by the browser. This includes using valid HTML and CSS, as well as ensuring that the code is properly structured and formatted.

Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing had a number of benefits for web accessibility. By ensuring that web content was structured in a way that was easily understood and interpreted by assistive technologies, this criterion helped to ensure that users with disabilities were able to access and use web content effectively. This could include users with visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments, as well as users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to navigate and interact with web content. By making web content more accessible to these users, Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing helped to increase the inclusiveness and accessibility of the web, which is a critical goal of web accessibility initiatives.

# The Removal of 4.1.1 Parsing

One of the most noteworthy changes in WCAG 2.2 is the removal of Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing. This change reflects the evolution of web accessibility and the advances in technology and accessibility standards. Originally adopted to address issues with assistive technology directly parsing HTML, this criterion was designed to ensure that web content was structured in a way that was easily understood and interpreted by these technologies. However, as the need for direct parsing has diminished, and the accessibility errors failed by this criterion are now covered by other criteria, it was determined that Success Criteria 4.1.1 Parsing no longer had any utility and was removed from WCAG 2.2.
