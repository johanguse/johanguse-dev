Developing web solutions since 2006.

As a web expert, I have extensive experience in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS, TypeScript, Jest, SASS, Styled Components, Bootstrap, Tailwind, VueJS, Jquery, WordPress, Responsive Design, Storybook, SVG Manipulation, WCAG, Design System Principles, UX/UI Concepts, Usability, Performance, and Testability. I am also skilled in back-end technologies like NodeJS, PHP, SQL, MySQL, Postgres, API RESTful, and GraphQL.

I am proficient in various tools and technologies such as Git, Jenkins, Github Actions, Webpack, Gulp, Core Web Vitals, Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and A/B testing. My understanding of web security, including OWASP, XSS, and CSRF, makes me an enthusiast in ensuring the security of web applications.

Also I have some experience with Mobile UI working with: Flutter, React Native, SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

Overall, I am a highly skilled software engineer with a passion for web accessibility and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
